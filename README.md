Deployed Website: https://andaww.github.io/jokeGenerator/

# Solution

To create this website, I utilized HTML & CSS to design and format my page, as well as Javascript to make my website interactive and to fetch data from JokeAPI. Using the JokeAPI I was able to separate the joke pool into specific categories and return a joke that is specified by the user. I also used Github Pages to host and deploy this website.
